					Hello and welcome to my basic bio! I'm originally from Manhattan Beach, CA but I was raised in the San Francisco Bay Area. Ever since I was a kid, I had a stong passion for music. I started playing guitar in middle school and eventually moved back to SoCal to attend Musician's Institute in Hollywood. After my studies at MI, I moved back to the Bay Area to study Recording Arts at Foothill College. 
				</p>

					While getting established as a performing musician and audio engineer, I got in to the restaurant industry as a server. I've worked at multiple restaurants, starting at P.F. Changs and currently at 5A5 Steak Lounge. My current goals are to continue to work in the restaurant industry while boosting my skills as a web developer, and transition into a full time web development job.
				</p>
